# Torrenzo

*Lightweight publishing pipeline for digital learning content*

![banner](README_banner.png)

---

## What Does It Do?

Torrenzo traverses structured learning content directories and generates LMS-ready HTML module pages and PDF assessment briefs from Markdown, BibTeX, and other source material.

Torrenzo currently performs the following transformations:

| Input                                         | Output |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------|
| `assessments/assessment_<n>/ass_<n>_brief.md` | PDF    |
| `modules/module_<n>/mod_<n>_content.md`       | HTML   |
| `modules/module_<n>/mod_<n>_content.docx`     | HTML   |
| `modules/module_<n>/mod_<n>_activities.md`    | HTML   |
| `modules/module_<n>/mod_<n>_activities.docx`  | HTML   |

See [sample_build](sample_build) for example output artefacts generated from the demo content.

### Yeah, But Why?

Torrenzo keeps learning content **portable, readable, and version-controlled**.

Instead of authoring material directly in a learning management system (LMS), content is written in plain-text formats such as Markdown and BibTeX. This approach enables:

- **Consistent metadata** defined once and reused everywhere (e.g., learning outcomes or assessment details)
- **Version control** using Git and other standard tools
- **Clear separation** of content and presentation
- **Editor independence** so you can write with any tool (Obsidian, VS Code, Vim, even MS Word?)
- **Machine-readable materials** that automation tools and AI can analyse and update
- **Extensible components** for reusable interface elements across multiple pages
- **Adaptable open-source tooling** to extend or customise for *your* publishing workflow

## Usage

1. Ensure to install [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
2. [Populate subject content](#populating-content) (`outline.md`, `assessments/`, and `modules/`).
3. Run Torrenzo from the repository root using `python torrenzo.py`

By default, Torrenzo scans the current directory. To target another workspace, use: `python torrenzo.py ../other-subject`

Torrenzo outputs everything (HTML, PDF, etc.) to the `build/` directory (which is cleared at the start of each run).

> 💡 Torrenzo supports writing, organising, and navigating content in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and includes an `.obsidian` configuration so that you can simply point a new vault at your Torrenzo project.


> 💡 Use `python torrenzo.py --optimize-assets` to optimise assets. This feature requires SVGO for SVG (provided via `npm install`). PNG optimisation requires `pngquant` or `oxipng` installed on your system.

---

## Configuration & Tags

Use `outline.md` as the single source of metadata, formatted in YAML. Use [Dataview-style](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview) tags in content, for example `` `=[[outline]].assessment.a1.weighting` `` or `` `=[[outline]].slo.a` ``

Starter keys in `outline.md` define your subject metadata and automatically populate across all content via tags/placeholders.

- **Subject:**  
  `subject.code`, `subject.title`, `subject.descriptor`
- **SLOs:**  
  Map under `slo` with codes (e.g., `slo.a`)
- **Assessments:**  
  Produce a full metadata table using `assessment.a1` or `assessment.a2`, etc.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node 18+** with `npm`
- **Terminal environment** of your choice

### Working Directory
All relative paths assume execution from the repository root. Set your working directory using:
```bash
cd <repository-root>
```

### Python Setup
To create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Node Setup
Required for PDF generation via `md-to-pdf`. To install Node dependencies locally:
```bash
npm install
```

## Repository Architecture

Torrenzo provides a ready-to-use structure for a single subject. The project is intentionally filesystem-driven: file names and directory structure determine how Torrenzo processes content.

Any `demo_`-prefixed items are included for illustration. You can delete them if you wish; otherwise they build normally and appear in the `build/` output.

```text
subject-root/
├── assessments/        # assessment briefs → PDF
│   ├── demo_assessment_1/
│   │   ├── ass_1_brief.md
│   │   └── assets/
│   ├── assessment_<n>/
│   │   ├── ass_<n>_brief.md
│   │   └── assets/
│   └── ...
├── modules/            # module content → HTML
│   ├── demo_module_1/
│   │   ├── mod_1_content.[md|docx]
│   │   ├── mod_1_activities.[md|docx]
│   │   └── assets/
│   ├── module_<n>/
│   │   ├── mod_<n>_content.[md|docx]
│   │   ├── mod_<n>_activities.[md|docx]
│   │   └── assets/
│   └── ...
├── build/              # generated output
├── outline.md          # subject configuration (YAML)
├── references.bib      # global references (BibTeX)
└── torrenzo.py         # run to build
```

### Populating Content

Subject content lives in two directories -- `assessments/` and `modules/`. Torrenzo relies on strict naming conventions in these directories to locate and process files.

- **Define global metadata** in `outline.md` (using YAML). Torrenzo injects these values wherever placeholders such as `` `=[[outline]].subject.title` `` appear in source Markdown files.

- **Define assessment briefs** in `assessments/assessment_<n>/ass_<n>_brief.md`. Place any assets the brief references (images, etc.) in the adjacent `assets/` directory.

- **Store reference sources** in `references.bib`. This file uses *BibTeX format*; in-text citations use the `@refname` syntax. Torrenzo renders the corresponding references at the bottom of the page.

- **Organise module files** using the same pattern under `modules/module_<n>/`. Each module contains:
  - `mod_<n>_content.[md|docx]` -- primary module content page(s)
  - `mod_<n>_activities.[md|docx]` -- activity page(s)
  - `assets/` -- supporting files (images, etc.) used within the module

> 💡 For multiple content or activity pages, add a suffix to the file name. For example: `mod_01_content_01.md`, `mod_01_content_02.md`, or `mod_01_activities_foo.md`, `mod_01_activities_bar.md`

During the build process, Torrenzo reads metadata from `outline.md` (SLOs, etc.) and converts source content into:

- PDF assessment briefs
- LMS-ready HTML module pages (including separate activity pages)

Torrenzo writes all output to `build/`. Module assets copy to `build/modules_html/assets`

When processing demo inputs, Torrenzo adds a `demo_` filename prefix to both HTML outputs and their asset filenames/paths. For non-demo inputs, it keeps the original base names. Torrenzo clears and regenerates the `build/` directory on each run.

### Module Styling

An optional global stylesheet lives at `modules/style/style.css`. Its rules inline into HTML output so styling survives LMS copy-paste without requiring additional stylesheets in the target LMS.

### Assessment Branding

Universal assessment branding assets live in `assessments/style/`. On each run, the build injects `logo.svg` into the PDF header. Replace `logo.svg` (must be an SVG) to use a different logo, and configure styling and header/footer elements via the `style.css` and `config.js`

## Technical Stuff

This section is intended for developers and contributors.

### Transformers

Torrenzo uses a plugin-style architecture with an extensible set of transformers:

| Transformer                                 | Conversion      |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `torrenzo_engine/renderers/bib_to_html.py`  | BibTeX → HTML   |
| `torrenzo_engine/renderers/docx_to_html.py` | MS Word → HTML  |
| `torrenzo_engine/renderers/md_to_html.py`   | Markdown → HTML |
| `torrenzo_engine/renderers/md_to_pdf.py`    | Markdown → PDF  |

> 💡 Note that MS Word is not a priority source format, so this has received the least attention. As a matter of personal preference, the Torrenzo contributor(s) do not spend time authoring content outside of Markdown.

Torrenzo supports additional transformers without modifying the core pipeline. Developers should extend it to new targets (e.g., Marp slides) without expanding the CLI driver. Potential candidates include:

- Marp `.md` → PDF (slide decks)
- Extended Markdown features for module pages (accordions, navigation tabs, and other LMS-specific markup)
- Really, the limit is your imagination and whatever an LMS can handle ...

### Common Cartridge

Preliminary investigation into **[Common Cartridge](https://www.1edtech.org/standards/cc)** suggests it can effectively bulk-populate new subjects, though it is likely less useful for ongoing maintenance where individual components change more sporadically and 'manual' updates remain manageable. The [common_cartridge_WIP](common_cartridge_WIP) directory contains exploratory work to understand the format and generate new cartridges that may later integrate into the build process.

- [ ] ... Implement a batch LMS content importer (via Tampermonkey or similar)?
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions to publish cross-platform CLI packages (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- [ ] ... and add one-click executable runner to the above?
- [ ] Devise mechanism to flag what is new build content (versus what won't need updating in LMS)
- [ ] ... and on the above, best to add meta/commented timestamp to built items.
- [ ] ...

### 'Maybe' Goals

- [ ] Consolidate on a single runtime stack (Python or Node)
- [ ] Add support for Marp slide decks
- [ ] Build an Obsidian extension/plugin to streamline authoring workflows (configuration, build commands, etc.)
- [ ] ...
